        <h1>AI-Assisted Software Upgrade<br>&mdash; How It Works</h1>
        <p>
            Our web applications are built on a technology platform that, like all software, needs to be
            periodically updated. This document explains how we use AI to handle those upgrades in a
            structured, low-risk way &mdash; and where you, as a stakeholder, are involved.
        </p>
        <div class="cover-meta">February 2026</div>
        <div class="lifecycle">
            Process: &nbsp; Step 1: AI Plans &rarr; You Approve &rarr; Step 2: Safety Check &rarr; Step 3: AI Upgrades
            &rarr; Step 4: AI Tests &rarr; Step 5: Optional Next Steps
        </div>
    </div>


    <!-- PHASE 1 -->
    <h2>Step 1 &mdash; AI Reviews the System and Builds a Plan</h2>

    <p>
        Before anything changes, the AI reads through the current state of the software &mdash; what version it is
        running,
        what other tools it depends on, and how the code is currently structured. It then reads the official
        documentation for the new version to understand what is different and what might break.
    </p>

    <h3>What the AI looks for:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Which version of the software is currently installed, and which version we are upgrading to</li>
        <li>Any tools or libraries that depend on the old version and may need updating too</li>
        <li>Features or functions that have been removed or changed in the new version</li>
        <li>Whether the server environment meets the minimum requirements for the new version</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What you receive:</h3>
    <p>
        A written <strong>Migration Plan</strong> in plain language, covering: what will change, what the
        risks are, an estimate of how long each step should take, and how to undo the upgrade if something
        goes seriously wrong.
    </p>

    <div class="notice">
        <strong>Human Approval Required &mdash; Gate 1.</strong><br />
        The AI stops completely at this point. Nothing is changed until you review the plan and give
        the go-ahead. You can ask questions, request that steps be changed, or decide to pause the
        upgrade entirely. You are in full control.
    </div>

    <hr />

    <!-- PHASE 2 -->
    <h2>Step 2 &mdash; Safety Checks Before Anything Changes</h2>

    <p>Once you have approved the plan, the AI performs two safety checks before touching any file:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Creates a backup snapshot.</strong> The current state of all code is saved so that,
            if anything goes wrong, everything can be restored to exactly how it was before. This is
            similar to creating a &ldquo;restore point&rdquo; on a computer before installing updates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Checks the server environment.</strong> The AI confirms that the server or computer
            running the application meets the minimum requirements for the new version. If it does not,
            the upgrade is paused immediately and you are notified &mdash; no changes are made.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <hr />

    <!-- PHASE 3 -->
    <h2>Step 3 &mdash; AI Carries Out the Upgrade</h2>

    <p>
        The AI works through the upgrade step by step, in the exact order set out in the approved plan.
        It keeps a live checklist so you can see which steps are complete and which are in progress.
    </p>

    <h3>What happens if something goes wrong?</h3>
    <p>
        The AI does not simply stop at the first sign of a problem. It follows a structured process
        before deciding whether to fix the issue itself or ask for your help:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Level</th>
            <th>What the AI does</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>First attempt</strong></td>
            <td>
                The AI tries the most common automatic fixes: adjusting settings, updating references
                to renamed features, or retrying the step with alternative options.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Second attempt</strong></td>
            <td>
                If the first attempt does not work, the AI searches official documentation and known
                issue records for the specific problem, then applies the documented solution.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Escalate to you</strong></td>
            <td>
                If neither attempt resolves the problem, the AI stops at that step. It writes a clear
                summary document listing: what was completed successfully, what the problem is,
                what still needs to be done, and suggested next steps for a developer. The AI then
                notifies you and waits for guidance.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        If escalated, no further changes are made. The completed work is preserved and the remaining
        steps are clearly documented so a developer can continue from exactly where the AI stopped.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <!-- PHASE 4 -->
    <h2>Step 4 &mdash; AI Tests Everything Automatically</h2>

    <p>
        After the upgrade (whether complete or partial), the AI runs a standard set of quality checks
        without any manual effort required. Think of this as the AI doing a structured inspection of
        the application before handing it back.
    </p>

    <h3>How the AI decides what to fix vs. what to escalate:</h3>
    <p>
        If a check finds problems, the AI decides how to respond based on how many issues were found:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Number of Issues Found</th>
            <th>What the AI Does</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>None</td>
            <td>Check passed. Move on.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A few (fewer than 10)</td>
            <td>AI fixes each one individually, re-runs the check to confirm, then continues.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A moderate number (10 to 50)</td>
            <td>AI fixes the recognisable, common issues, re-runs the check once, then reports what remains and
                continues to the next check.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A large number (more than 50)</td>
            <td>
                <strong>AI stops attempting fixes.</strong> A list of all issues is saved to a handover
                document. The AI finishes running the remaining checks (to get a full picture) but makes
                no further changes. You are then notified and the decision is yours on how to proceed.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        <em>Why stop at 50 issues?</em> At that scale, the problems are almost always caused by
        something fundamental &mdash; a third-party tool that is not yet compatible with the new
        version, or a decision that requires human judgement. Trying to automatically fix hundreds
        of issues would risk making things worse and could take an unreasonably long time.
    </p>

    <h3>What gets checked:</h3>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Check</th>
            <th>What it verifies</th>
            <th>If it fails</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Code integrity</td>
            <td>No coding errors that would prevent the application from being built</td>
            <td>Apply the issue-count policy above</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Test version build</td>
            <td>The application compiles and packages correctly in a development environment</td>
            <td>Apply the issue-count policy above</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Live version build</td>
            <td>The application is ready to be deployed to production</td>
            <td>Skipped automatically if the test build failed with too many issues</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Code quality</td>
            <td>The code meets defined quality standards; common issues are auto-corrected</td>
            <td>Apply the issue-count policy above to any remaining issues</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Application startup</td>
            <td>The application actually starts and runs without crashing</td>
            <td>Skipped if the build failed; otherwise the error is recorded</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>File size check</td>
            <td>The application has not become significantly larger (which would slow it down for users)</td>
            <td>Flagged for review if the size increased by more than 20%</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>A summary report is produced showing the result of each check, how many issues were found, and whether they were
        fixed, flagged, or handed over.</p>

    <hr />

    <!-- PHASE 5 -->
    <h2>Step 5 &mdash; Optional Recommendations</h2>

    <p>
        After completing the upgrade and testing, the AI produces a list of optional improvements
        that were outside the scope of the upgrade itself but are worth considering. These are
        prioritised into three groups:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Priority</th>
            <th>Examples</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Should do soon</strong></td>
            <td>Modernise parts of the code that still use older patterns; enable stricter quality checks; update
                outdated functions to current equivalents</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Do when possible</strong></td>
            <td>Clean up unnecessary code; adopt newer, faster ways of writing logic; switch to a faster build tool</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Nice to have</strong></td>
            <td>Install developer productivity tools; update the automated testing setup to a more modern framework</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="notice">
        <strong>Your decision &mdash; Gate 2.</strong><br />
        This list is informational only. You decide which items (if any) to act on.
        If you choose to proceed with any of them, a separate, focused process is started for those
        specific improvements.
    </div>

    <hr />

    <!-- DOCUMENTS -->
    <h2>Documents Produced During the Process</h2>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Document</th>
            <th>When you receive it</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Migration Plan</td>
            <td>End of Step 1</td>
            <td>Full description of the upgrade: what changes, what the risks are, how long it takes, and how to roll
                back. Requires your approval before anything proceeds.</td>
        </tr>

            <td>During Step 3</td>
            <td>A live record of every task in the upgrade, updated as each step is completed.</td>

            <td>Handover Document</td>
            <td>Only if the AI gets stuck</td>
            <td>A clear summary of what was done, what the problem is, what is left to do, and suggested next steps for
                a developer to continue.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Recommendations</td>
            <td>End of Step 5</td>
